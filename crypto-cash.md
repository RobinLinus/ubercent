#Crypto Cash

Desired properties of digital cash to be practical:
- works offline
- no batteries
- proves validity
- forgery prove
- easily convertable into "online" money (Ethereum | SEPA, Paypal, ... )


## Ideas 
### One-time self-printed cash 
- everybody can print it's own cash with a regular printer.
- cash receiver scans the bill and redeems it immediatly. 
- if the amount appears in receiver's wallet, the transaction was valid and secure. 

### RFID-based one-time cash
- same system as self-printed, but with reusable RFID tokens 


### zero-knowledge proof with RF-powered computation
